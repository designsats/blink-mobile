 *
 * Only a SUBSET of `start-refused` is actually restart-resolvable: the backend maps its

 * transient conflict, so the client cannot tell them apart. Those users spend one restart
 * before the copy's "still seeing this screen?" line sends them to support, which is the

 * permanent refusals would let them keep the support-first copy.
