 * control. The support address doubles as a copy control: tapping it puts the address on the
 * clipboard, for a user whose mail app the Contact us button cannot open. The header back
 * control and the hardware back return to the commit point (Step 8) when support was opened
 * mid-migration, or dismiss the screen when it was opened by the completed-migration resume
 * handover; the visible control covers iOS, which has no hardware back.
