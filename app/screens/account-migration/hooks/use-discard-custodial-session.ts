 * device token; a failed revocation never blocks the migration (the mutation is raced against a
 * short timeout and errors are only recorded). A closed account can neither be revoked nor
 * detach its token: `accountDelete` deletes the Kratos identity, so nothing is left to
 * authenticate the logout with. The token it leaves behind is inert for payments, which a
 * `Closed` account cannot receive, and is the backend's to clear on deletion (blink#758).
