 *
 * `custodialAccountId` covers the handover raised after the session was already discarded:
 * the `me` query is skipped for a signed-out custodial account, so without it the ticket
 * would name nothing that identifies the account support has to act on. It wins over the
 * query, which can still answer for another live session and name the wrong account.
